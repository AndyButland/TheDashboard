The Dashboard
=====

This is a magic dashboard for Umbraco 7, it's actually "The dashboard". It will show editors a summary of the latest activities on the website combined with each editors recent files and other useful information.

> **Note:** This the first release that was developed during breaks at CodeGarden15 and it has been tested on Umbraco 7.1, if you have any issues, please collaborate with me here https://github.com/enkelmedia/TheDashboard

##Installation
Just build the package using the included build script and upload the zip file to the Umbraco back-office. There will be a nuget package soon as well.
